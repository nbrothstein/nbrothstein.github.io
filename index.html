  <h1 style="text-align:center;">About Me</h1>



  <body style="text-align:center;">Noah Rothstein is a sophomore at Howard Community College where he majors in Audio Video Media Production. After graduation, Noah hopes to utilize the skills and knowledge he’s obtained and work in various multimedia formats as a sound designer. Noah has over 10 years of experience in the customer service industry. He is currently a waiter, and through this job has developed strong communication,  time management, and organization skills. Noah took a ten-month hiatus from being a server to work as a sales agent at Aspen Skiing Company, and as valet at a luxury boutique hotel in Aspen, Colorado. At this job, Noah showed great attention to detail when handling guest’s vehicles and luggage, he provided efficient services to all clientele, and collaborated with members from different departments of the hotel.
Noah also has over three years of experience with Ableton Live, and one year of experience with ProTools. His interest in this major began at a young age due to his fascinations with music and video games. In Noah’s free time, he enjoys listening to and creating music, spending time with family, and snowboarding during the winter months.
